# termux-dotfiles
This repository contains my personal configuration files and dotfiles for Termux. It includes configurations for various tools and utilities used in my Termux environment. These files are intended to provide a consistent setup across different devices and installations.

To install the `termux-dotfiles` configuration, run the following command in your Termux terminal:

```bash

This script will clone the repository and copy the necessary files into your Termux configuration directories.

## Customization

You can modify the configuration files to suit your preferences. For example, you can change the appearance of the Fish shell prompt or add new plugins to Neovim. The files are modular, so you can easily adapt them to your own workflow.
